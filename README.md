# YouTube_trending_data_analytics_pipeline
This is an end-to-end pipeline that extracts data from the Kaggle dataset, transforms it, and finally creates visualisation on top of it.
This is my first Data Engineeirng project, and I plan on taking this forward by building something on this, that can be used in real-time, i.e. orechestrate workflows and try to build and deploy a useful ML model using this data, so that I understand the whole process end-to-end.
